 * IIFI allows us to have data privacy because it creats a new scope
 * that is not visible from the outside scope
 * variables and methods cannot be accessed from the outside
 * 
 * the screat of the module pattern is that 
 * it returns an object that containing all of the functions that we want to be public 
 * so the functions that we want to give the outside scope access to 
 * the functions in this returned object can use inner functions, variables
